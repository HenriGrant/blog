### Project Gutenburg
This is a website that provides public domain ebooks for free. I recommend this resource for anyone looking to buy books in the public domain, search for it here first.

### Local Libraries

Libraries are a great way to read, watch movies, and now even play some games (mainly for demoing). If you want to check out a book or movie before buying, the library is the place to go. It is also great for research for school.

### Half Price Books

I know this company is a tad corrupt, but it truly is a great way to buy books. You can either order online or visit your local HPB.


### Edx

If you want to learn how to program, Edx is a great way to learn. They have courses from Harvard, MIT, IBM, Georgia Tech, and more. Some of their courses are free, some cost money. But all cost money to receive a certificate in that class.

Edx also has other subjects, but computer science is their biggest.
